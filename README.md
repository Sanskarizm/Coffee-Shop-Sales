# Coffee-Shop-Sales
In this I did analysis on sales of a coffee shop and take out some insights to improve the sales in different outlet.
* Created an automated dashboard for a Coffee Shop facing challenges in scalling their sales and revenue and lacking actionable insights.
* Performed data analysis using Microsoft Excel to track:
  * Total Revenue
  * Sales
    * Day-wise
    * Month-wise
  * Sales on different outlets
  * Average bill per person
  * Average order
  
* The dashboard enabled quick, data-informed decisions, effectively displaying sales trends and potentially raising revenue by at least 7% in the next quarter.
